Tapa Project

Tapa Project is a platform under which participants can express, discuss, and collaborate to 
create various art works with having to worry less about their intellectual property being pirated. 
Participants of this project will be considered "artists", since they will be making posts about 
scribbles, paintings, or any other forms of creativity they feel like sharing with the public. The posts 
made by the artists will be digitally signed and stored in the server, which will then be used to 
identify the author of the post upon necessity.
